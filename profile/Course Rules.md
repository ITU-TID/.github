# Literature
- Texbooks for ID -- too theoretical
- Technical books -- too obsolete
- Sometimes we will point you to online articles that we think are the best
- Lecture notes will be always published in this repo; slides on LearnIt
- If you see opportunities for improving the lecture notes - send a PR üôè

# Code
- Project code should be hosted on GitHub (the public one, not the ITU internal) in the ITU-TID organization
- The main branch should be protected from merge without a review by the TID staff
- The actual work is done on feature branches

# Communication
- If a question is of general interest, write to the LearnIt forum
- For personal stuff reach Mircea, Cecil, or Iga
# Group Formation
- Project work is done in groups of 4 students
- In the first course hour we hold a democratic vote whether to randomly form groups or to self-organize
	- Random groups - will be generated using Javascript in class
	- Self-organized groups
		- Have till next Wednesday@noon to figure out whom they want to work with
		- You can use LearnIt to find group members
		- Whomever is still not in a group is randomly assigned
# Deliverables
- Are due on Wednesday@noon
- You can submit also later, but you will not receive feedback
- Feedback is going to be collected and shared in class, not always personal; we expect you to be in class for the feedback, and learn from it also for your project
