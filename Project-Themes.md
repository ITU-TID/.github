## Project 1: A Messaging Client
- You have to implement a variation of WhatsApp for a special audience?
- E.g. the elderly would want a very simple application, etc.

## Project 2: A Centralized Social Sharing Website 

This is pretty much your chance to reimplement a Twitter-like project, but better :) And just as in the previous themes, make sure that you have a very specific type of user in mind.
